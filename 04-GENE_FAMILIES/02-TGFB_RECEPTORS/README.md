# Commands, alignment file, and custom script for TGF-beta receptor analysis

* tgfb_receptor_commands.md - commands to perform phylogenetic analyses

* pang.rec.fa - alignment file from Pang et al. (2011)

* rename_remove_seqs_tgfb_receptors.pl - custom script that removes isoforms and select sequences with gaps for this analysis. This scripts also renames sequences for clarity (requires [JFR-PerlModules](https://github.com/josephryan/JFR-PerlModules))
