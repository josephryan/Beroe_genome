# Beroe_genome

Phylotocol, commands, scripts, and alignments used and produced as part of this study

* 01-PHYLOTOCOLS - A phylotocol was used to plan phylogenetic analyses prior to conducting said analyses

* 02-ASSEMBLY - commands and scripts used for assembling the *Beroe ovata* genome

* 03-ANNOTATION - commands and scripts used for annotating the *Beroe ovata* genome

* 04-GENE_FAMILIES - commands, scripts, and alignments used for phylogenetic analyses of gene families

* 05-DIFFERENTIAL_GENE_EXPRESSION - Commands, sample files, and scripts used for differential gene expression analysis

* 06-TRANSCRIPTOME_ASSEMBLY - commands used to assemble transcriptome

* 07-MACROSYNTENY - scripts and data associated with macrosynteny analyses

* 08-MINIPROT_CHITINASE_ANALYSIS - additional analyses to show absence of chitinase int he B. ovata genome

* 09-MITOCHONDRIAL_DNA - Beroe ovata mitochondrial genome and annotations

* 10-1.4_to_1.5 - Commands and scripts used to update Bova annotations between version 1.4 to version 1.5.  Version 1.4 had some gene annotations that were actually isoforms of other genes. These scripts corrected this problem.
